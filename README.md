**DESCRIPTION FOR 3rd SCRIPT:** I am writing this script to perform dailly task as a devops engineer for maintaing, managing, configuring, and also 
checking the health check of vm's are running with different application in the organization. If any problem arises related vm's then pull out the 
script from git hub to local repository and then execute it. This shell script allows to access to each of the vm's and finds out the problem like -

CPU outage

Memory outage

Storage outage

CONCLUSION: Then it will send an automated message to devops engineer and this is the outcome of finding a related problem about the VM's.

**DESCRIPTION FOR 4th SCRIPT:** There are different types of process running on the machine if we want to find out very specific process running on 
the machine - in this case we are looking for all the ec2 -user process is running and the output will be printed out only with the process id
