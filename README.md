**DESCRIPTION FOR 3rd SCRIPT:** I am writing this script to perform dailly task as a devops engineer for maintaing, managing, configuring, and also 
checking the health check of vm's are running with different application in the organization. If any problem arises related vm's then pull out the 
script from git hub to local repository and then execute it. This shell script allows to access to each of the vm's and finds out the problem like -

CPU outage

Memory outage

Storage outage

CONCLUSION: Then it will send an automated message to devops engineer and this is the outcome of finding a related problem about the VM's.

**DESCRIPTION FOR 4th SCRIPT:** There are different types of process running on the machine if we want to find out very specific process running on 
the machine - in this case we are looking for all the ec2 -user process is running and the output will be printed out only with the process id 
of the ec2- user.

**DESCRIPTION FOR VARIABLE SCRIPT:** In shell scripting, a variable is a symbolic name that represents or refers to a value. Variables can 
hold various types of data such as strings, integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and more. They provide a way to store and 
manipulate data within a script. In most shell scripting languages like Bash, variables are typically defined without specifying their
data types explicitly.
Variables are defined using an assignment operation, and their values can be accessed or modified using the variable name preceded by a
dollar sign $. Here's a basic syntax for defining a variable:

**name="xyz"
echo "My name is $name"**
